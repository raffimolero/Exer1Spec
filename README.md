the ACTUAL exer1 is inside the molero folder. since i'm preprocessing stuff to make my life easier, i have the rest of the files actually separate from the exer1 folder.

please install php and imagemagick before running this program. it's designed for windows because i hate having fun.

i recommend installing both through scoop.

use these commands to install scoop:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression

and then run these commands:

    scoop install php
    scoop install imagemagick
